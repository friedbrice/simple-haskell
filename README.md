# SimpleHaskell

A low-feature Haskell package for Sublime Text

## Description and Goals

This package aims to support Haskell development on Sublime Text without relying on specific build tools or project structure.

Right now, this package focuses on fixing issues with syntax highlighting and providing some rudimentary completions.

Future directions might involve adding a simple build system based on [ghcid](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid) and slightly-more intelligent code completion.

## Credits

Syntax highlighting is based on the default _Haskell.sublime-syntax_ file included with Sublime Text.

Multi-line string support by [SQbQxeKd3JHD8](https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell/pull/422).
